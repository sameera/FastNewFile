# FastNewFile
Visual Studio 2017 Extension for Adding a New File quickly.


This extension was forked from [Mads Kristensen's Add File](https://github.com/madskristensen/AddAnyFile) extension to support VS's build in templates. Since merging this repo,  the original extension seems to have evolved without continuing to support Visual Studio templates, I'm going to leave this fork unsynced with the original.

Due to this, this repo has additional features that the original extension does not; such as the suggesting a file extension when on the file name prompt. It may also be missing features that the current version of the original extension has as no attempt has been made to keep the extension current with the original code base.
